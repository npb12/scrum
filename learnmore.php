<div id=\"headview\">What is ScrumBLD?</div>
<div id=\"tainview\"></div>

<div id=\"contview\">ScrumBLD is a network of people who are interested in the development of ideas through a collaborative effort within the community</div>


<div id=\"headview\">How does it work?</div>
<div id=\"tainview\"></div>

<div id=\"contview\">A user with an idea for a product posts a description and the skills needed for the development of the idea to the ScrumBLD projects feed. Users who are interested in the potential of the idea and would like to contribute to the development then ask the project creator to join the team. The project creator then decides whether the user would be beneficial to the team being put together, accepting or denying the users request. Once the team has been selected, this team organizes a plan for the development of the idea and then proceeds onto the development process.</div>


<div id=\"headview\">Why use it?</div>
<div id=\"tainview\"></div>

<div id=\"contview\">A lot of times, ideas are created by one vision, but the product of the idea is rarely a one man job. Scrumbld's goal is to change these ideas into physical products through the collaborative effort of community members who can help in the development of these products.</div>


<div id=\"headview\">What can we do with these ideas?</div>
<div id=\"tainview\"></div>

<div id=\"contview\">The possibilities lie within the team and how much potential the idea has.<br>
-Develop the project with your team and see where it takes you<br>
-Bring your idea and team to a crowd funding platform to look for funding<br>
-Seek investors<br>
-Enter an accelarator  </div>


<div id=\"headview\">Who is ScrumBLD for?</div>
<div id=\"tainview\"></div>

<div id=\"contview\">Anyone who can help with the development process of a product in any way. If you have a brilliant idea, bring it to the community and see how far it can go with the team you build.</div>



<div id=\"headview\">I don't want my idea to be stolen!</div>
<div id=\"tainview\"></div>

<div id=\"contview\">
As ScrumBLD has a similar concept to crowd funding platforms, where ideas are put out to the public, we at ScrumBLD believe that the community can have moral towards its fellow members. Also, the difference being users have the ability to be apart of a project rather than just be apart of the funding of it, so they would be less inclined to steal the idea and more inclined to join.<br>
*See private projects (below) for those who still aren't willing to post their idea to the community.
</div>


<div id=\"headview\">How does a private project work?</div>
<div id=\"tainview\"></div>

<div id=\"contview\">A private project gives users the ability to see a short description of the project, but not the full details. If a user sparked an interest in the short description, they can send a view request to the project creator. The project creator can then evaluate the users profile and experience accepting or denying the users request. With accepting the users view request, the user now has the ability to see the projects full details and may request to join the team. </div><br><br>
